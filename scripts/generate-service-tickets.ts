Include a variety of ticket types:
- Maintenance issues (broken equipment, cleaning needs, supplies)
- Environmental issues (temperature, lighting, air quality)
- General facility requests

For each ticket, provide:
1. A concise, professional title (max 60 characters)
2. A detailed description explaining the issue, location, and urgency
3. Appropriate severity level (low, medium, high, critical)
4. Realistic ticket type (maintenance, environmental, capacity_violation)

Examples of realistic tickets:
- "Conference Room 3A - Whiteboard markers dried out"
- "Kitchen Area - Coffee machine needs descaling"
- "Reception - Plants need watering"
- "Floor 4 - Temperature too cold in hallway"
- "Boardroom - Projector screen stuck halfway"
- "Break Room - Refrigerator making loud noise"
- "Lobby - Automatic door sensor not working"
- "Restroom - Paper towel dispenser empty"

Return the tickets as a JSON array with this exact structure:
